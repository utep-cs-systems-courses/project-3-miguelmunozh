## Blinky-Buzzy Toy
For this lab I used the MSP430 microcontroller and my creativity to dessign
the toy.

This toy can:
* generate sounds
* dinamically change the LEDs that are illuminated
* implement state machine

## Explanation
Once you use the command __make_load you can use the four top buttons of the
MSP430.
_In button one: you can listen a song in the MSP430.
_In button two: you can see the LEDs turning on and off to count in binary
from 0 to 3 (eg. 00,01,10,11) the ones represent the light on red,green as in
my MSP430.
_In button three: you can listen a different song but this time the LEDs turn
on and off at the rithm of the music.
_In button four: you can see the LEDs turning off and off with certain pattern
like in blink_demo.
