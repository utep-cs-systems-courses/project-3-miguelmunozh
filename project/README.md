## LCD Toy
For this lab I used the MSP430 microcontroller and my creativity to dessign
the toy.

This toy can:
* generate sounds
* dinamically change the LEDs that are illuminated
* implement state machine
* sraw custom shapes to the screen and move them
* turn on and off the cpu

By pressing the first button of the msp430 you can move a square to form the
character M
